Describe following modules: vocabulary, locator, contextualizer, view, state

By default, vocabulary object is bound under variables called 'v' and 'vocabulary'.

By default, locator object is bound under variables called 'l' and 'locator'.

Currently only one instance of Vocabulary per JVM is allowed. This might change in the future, 
depending on requirements.

Currently, up to 4 different instances of Locator are allowed per JVM. There can be one instance
of locator for each of the following stores: IMKVS (Infinispan i.e. Jboss Data Grid), ADS (Sybase IQ)
and two locators for BDS: one for Hbase and one for Hive/Impala.

Name of both core and conf has to match in order to correctly apply conf to core. Name is general
tag from XML.

TODO concurrency tuning...

variable names have to begin with var_ as internal convention...

Name of directory in which policy is deployed has to follow pattern com.ericsson.component.aia.wcdma_test-policy_1.0
Name of core file has to be core.xml
Name of conf file has to follow pattern conf_1.xml where 1 is id of conf.
Do not create directories under any of the policy dirs.

"Premature optimization is root of all evil", hence performance shall be tested and tuned with first actual feature.

Core.xml is currently in the process of being added to the model service, once done updates will be required to add the project and update our own.
conf.xml is considered meta data and thus does not live inside the modeling service.

Deployer assumes that movement of directories is atomic. That is how new policies should be deployed by
moving directory into directory which is periodically scanned by deployer.

Need to imperically look at performance once we have a valid use case implemented current logs look something like this, further the samples taken here represent some of the worst values:

15:42:18.860 [eps-hazelcast-input-adapter-70835964-e484-4f3f-bbf0-50884405fc0000] WARN  c.e.o.s.e.b.c.m.r.s.StatelessRule - The rule isu60_consumed_credits_threshold_matrix is exceeding the current evaluation time limit of 0, the evaluation duration was 5

Additionally worth looking into is thread blocking as this was part of a unit test output threads were restricted but the following was seen in the output:
15:42:19.248 [eps-hazelcast-input-adapter-70835964-e484-4f3f-bbf0-50884405fc0003] WARN  c.e.o.s.e.b.c.m.r.s.StatefulRule - The rule isu60_consumed_credits_threshold_singleton is exceeding the current evaluation time limit of 0, the evaluation duration was 83
