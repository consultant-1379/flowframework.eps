EPS can be started by invoking eps.sh script in EPS_HOME/bin/ folder

eps.sh script accepts parameters (see eps.sh for more details) and every EPS instance can be customized separately.

It is recommended to create separate Linux service (separate start script),
customize EPS instance there and then invoke EPS_HOME/bin/eps.sh from there.
