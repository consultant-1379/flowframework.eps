All jar files found directly inside this folder are automatically added to the classpath when EPS is started.

This folder should be used for any external dependencies (solution-set specific) needed by EPS.

Dependencies needed by core EPS can be found in EPS_HOME/lib/ folder.

Solution sets MUST NOT put any of their dependencies inside EPS_HOME/lib/ folder!
